With PowerShell, you must ensure Get-ExecutionPolicy is not Restricted. We suggest using Bypass to bypass the policy to get things installed or AllSigned for quite a bit more security.

Run Get-ExecutionPolicy. If it returns Restricted, then run Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned or Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process.

Now run the following command:
------------------------------
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

Now setup choco with below:
--------------------------
step 1a:
choco install -y nodejs-lts microsoft-openjdk17
		OR
step 1b:
choco install -y nvm microsoft-openjdk17 androidstudio vscode
nvm install latest
nvm use latest

node -v
npm -v
java -version

step 2:
click android studio icon and continue the install process

To start reactnative on powershell without error
---------------------------
First, open PowerShell with Run as Administrator
Run: Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
